Themey is A collection of open source themes for your Godot 4.x game. [Test out the live web build of Themey here](https://wadlo.github.io/Themey/). Each theme includes all necessary files, the theme's `.tres` file, and is free to use both personally and comercially.

## Others
Coming soon! If there's a styled UI you need, please reach out to the Discord. We're always looking for feedback and love meeting other devs.

# Setup
Each theme folder includes a `.tres` file and all necessary images for you to use that theme. Don't forget when copying the files over to include the `themes` folder at the root of your Godot project so imports aren't messed up.

Example: res:/themes/clashy

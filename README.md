## Others
Available upon request. If there's a styled UI you need, let us know either by creating an issue in Github or reaching out on Discord.

# Setup
Each theme folder includes a `.tres` file and all necessary images for you to use that theme. Don't forget when copying the files over to include the `themes` folder at the root of your Godot project so imports aren't messed up.

Example: res:/themes/clashy
